Chicago Socioeconomic Indicators, Chicago Public Schools, Chicago Crime Data
I worked on a dataset provided by the Chicago Data Portal supplied by a non-profit organization that strives to improve educational outcomes for children and youth in the City of Chicago. I analyzed the census, crime, and school data for a given neighborhood or district. Also identified are causes that impact schools' enrollment, safety, health, and environment ratings.
